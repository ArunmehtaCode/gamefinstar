# 💸 Budget Blitz

**Budget Blitz** is a fast-paced, fun, and educational mobile-friendly game(mainly made for our gamified finance learning app FINSTAR) designed to help teens (14–19) learn the basics of **money management** — differentiating between **Needs**, **Wants**, and **Savings** — while playing an engaging, animated drag-and-drop challenge.

---

## 🧠 Concept

Players must categorize falling expenses (like "Pizza", "Bus Fare", or "New T-shirt") into the correct buckets — **Needs**, **Wants**, or **Savings** — before they hit the ground.

Each correct drop increases the score, while one wrong move ends the game!  
As players progress, the speed increases and surprise pop-ups celebrate their milestones.
